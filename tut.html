    <h1>Tutorial on Modding Standalone</h1>

    <h2>
        *FOR THIS TUTORIAL YOU WILL NEED A PHONE/PC FOR SIDEQUEST*
    </h2>
    <p>
        First step is to get Lemon Loader. To download the Lemon Loader APK we need to first download a File Manager such as Mobile VR Station, CX File Explorer, Amaze, File Manager+, etc.
    </p>
    <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/TyJozGmSa-Y?si=SB9vJfGoXfOzxWte">YOUTUBE LINK - This Tutorial shows how to install APKs with Mobile VR Station</a>
    <p>
        Now we need the Lemon Loader APK.
    </p>
    <a class="link" href="https://github.com/LemonLoader/MelonLoader/releases/download/0.6.5.1/com.lavagang.melonloader.installer.apk">GITHUB DOWNLOAD LINK - This link downloads the Lemon Loader APK</a>
    <p>
        Once you install the Lemon Loader APK onto your headset, go to Unknown Sources and Launch Lemon Loader. Once in Lemon Loader, it should say "OBB Folder Permission", press "Skip". Then find the Game Application, press it and press "Patch". After its done patching, its going to say "Failed to save Data!", press "Yes". You will now get a prompt asking you to reinstall/uninstall the app, press "Yes". Then when it asks you to update it or install it, also press "Yes". Once that is finished you can close out of Lemon Loader. Once everything is done patching and reintalling/updating, going into the game so it creates all the needed folders. THIS MAY TAKE A WHILE! Usually takes somewhere from 2-10 minutes but when your game successfully loads, you can exit out of it. Now you will need a cable that can connect your headset to your PC or Android Phone (your Quest charging cable should work). You will also need to install Sidequest.
    </p>
        <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/wNku19Hl9Dw?si=GtaeFTcnK-Hl1oPh">YOUTUBE LINK - This video shows how to install Sidequest.</a>
    <p>
        Once Sidequest is fully setup you can use the File Manager window at the top of Sidequest Tools (it should be like a Folder Icon). Once there go to "Android > Data > com.(Name of Author).(Name of the Game) > Files > Mods". You will have to download and paste a Mod Menu or Mods into this Location. You can just search up "Gtag DLLs" or something like that to find a DLL of a Mod Menu. Once you have the Download File, put the file into the Location we previously talked about. Once the file is in you are Ready to Go!
